# probabilistic_symmtries
```
pip install dm_control, torch, imageio, wandb, matplotlib 
```
and few other dependencies....


# To run 
```
python symmetries_with_baseline.py 
```
To run the code, use the appropariate flags for baselines, the default is to run for Prob. Symm. algorithm with 4 rotation samples and learned normal distribution.
